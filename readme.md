# HexaDoken Legacy Continued

[![Nightly Build](https://github.com/HDest-Community/HexaDoken-Legacy-Continued/actions/workflows/nightly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HDest-Community/HexaDoken-Legacy-Continued/actions/workflows/nightly.yml)

_Requires [HDBulletLib-Recasted](https://github.com/HDest-Community/HDBulletLib-Recasted), supports the 9mm Clip from [Peppergrinder](https://gitlab.com/hdiscord-saltmines/hd-peppergrinder)_

This is a fix/update of HexaDoken's original 'Hideous Destructor' addons.
It currently adds both recast support and proper spawners for the No-Scope Boss.
Current plans are to update most of HexaDoken's addons and add them to this, minus the vanilla items like the Speedloader hunter and revolver, which get ted-tweaks treatment.

Credits:

- HexaDoken, for the original addons.
- Potetobloke and Carbine Dioxide for the M1 Garand pickup sprite
- Kris, for the recast fixes and support for the No-Scope Boss.
- FDA, for the Event Handler and Menu code.
- Undead Zeratul, for updating Boss variants to latest HDest, updating Spawn Handlers & menus.
- Boss Rifle Code: MatthewTheGlutton/Matt, Hideous Destructor

TO-DO:

- Speedloader Hunter and Revolver (likely to be added to Ted-Tweaks instead)
- Fix his detachables addon (likely to be added to Ted-Tweaks instead to be better integrated)
- Add MiniCyberdemons
